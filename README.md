Project Rosetta: Writing the same programs in multiple languages.


01: helloworld - print a sentence (output)

02: 99 Bottes - looping over a print statement (loops)

03: primes - print the prime numbers under 100 (loops, function calls, conditionals)

04: add2 - prompt the user for two variables, add them, then print the result (read from stdin, arithmetic) 

05: printfile - prompt the user for a file path, read in that file, and print the file (read from stdin, file input)
